⭐ Project Overview

This project is an interactive and visually clear simulation of the Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm.
It uses a Python-based GUI to help students understand how Round Robin works by showing:

how processes enter the ready queue

how CPU time is shared equally when preemption happens

how waiting & turnaround times are calculated

The focus is on clarity, learning, and easy visualization, not just output.

🖥️ Key Features

✨ Simple & Clean GUI made using Tkinter
🌀 Step-by-step execution animation
📦 Ready Queue visualization
⏱️ Custom Time Quantum input
📊 Auto-generated Gantt Chart using Matplotlib
📘 Table of WT, TAT, CT for each process
📉 Average waiting & turnaround time displayed automatically
🔄 Fair CPU sharing simulation (true RR behavior)

🧠 Understanding Round Robin (RR) – In Simple Words

Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling technique.

Every process gets a fixed time quantum ⏳.
If it still needs more time after that, it goes back to the queue and waits for its next turn.

💡 Why it’s important:

Ensures fairness

Eliminates starvation

Ideal for time-sharing systems

Used widely in modern OS designs

🚀 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Run the Python File

Final Gantt chart

Detailed result table

🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

🟦 Python – Main programming language
🪟 Tkinter – GUI controls, buttons, tables, labels
📊 Matplotlib – For generating Gantt chart
🕒 Time module – For animation timing

📊 What Output You Get

✔ Gantt Chart
✔ Ready Queue logs
✔ Process execution timeline
✔ Completion Time
✔ Waiting Time
✔ Turnaround Time
✔ Average WT & TAT

All presented in a clear GUI format.

🎓 What I Learned

Through this project, I understood:

🔹 How preemption works in scheduling
🔹 How Round Robin shares CPU time
🔹 How to implement scheduling logic in Python
🔹 How to build a GUI using Tkinter
🔹 How to plot charts programmatically
🔹 How to break an algorithm into visual steps

This project improved both my OS concepts and Python GUI skills.

🔮 Future Improvements

Some ideas I may add later:

🌈 Dark/Light theme switch
📂 Export results as PDF or CSV
🎮 More animations
🧮 Add other algorithms: SJF, Priority, FCFS
📱 Mobile-friendly version in HTML

🙏 Acknowledgement

I am grateful to Ms. Aparna Sharma mam for guiding me throughout this project and helping me understand scheduling concepts in depth.
